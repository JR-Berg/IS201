                            <p>Due to my religious obligations, I was to serve a 2 year mission starting in 2021 and concluding in 2023. Due to circumstances, this mission was centered on Community Service rather than preaching my religious gospel. These are some of the volunteer opportunities I did for those 2 years:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Volunteered as a Front Desk worker and fitness section monitor for the local YMCA.</li>
                                <li>Volunteered many hours (200+) at the El Pasoans Fighting Hunger food bank.</li>
                                <li>Served at the Las Cruces Bishop's Storehouse [1 hour drive from my home].</li>
                                <li>Taught beginner-level piano lessons to students of varying ages.</li>
                                <li>Volunteered as an assistant to my old high school's IT workers. Frequently was the driver to pick up lunch, handled menial busywork they couldn't tend to easily.</li>
                                <li>Served at the Global Service Department as an email-based IT worker, responding to questions, issues, and feedback about our Member Tools app. Was asked to train others on how to work on cases, and eventually "promoted" to being able to assign cases and oversee the work of others.</li>
                                <li>Served as a Temple Ordinance Worker in Oklahoma City.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">College Experiences</h2>
                            <p>While I haven't graduated from college yet, I have still had some work experiences to share.</p>
                            <ul>
