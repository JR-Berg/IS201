        <h1>About me!</h1>
    </div>
    <h6>
        Note: This webpage is to demonstrate knowledge of how to use HTML, not to demonstrate a sense of aesthetic aptitude.
        I am good at making things show up a certain way on a website, I am not good at knowing what a good website looks like.

    <p>Some things that are important to know about me:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I'm color blind. Some combinations that are especially challenging to me include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Blue/Purple (impossible for me to tell apart without prior knowledge of what an item's color is)</li>
            <li>Red/Green</li>
            <li>Green/Yellow</li>
            <li>Pink/Grey</li>
            <li>Dark green or dark red/Brown</li>
            <li>Dark colors in general are problematic for me</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I have severe ADHD</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I have found that caffeine can help with this, and I am generally fairly good at managing this.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I very much enjoy ironic humor, such as poorly designed webpages.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These things can cause issues if somebody doesn't know them when they are tasked with working alongside me, but with proper communication, I can adapt to fit situations well enough for the most part.</p>
    <div class="Topic">
        <h2>Some examples of what I find ironically humorous!</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="why">This. Bad text formats are hilarious to me!</p>
    <p class="dabby">Or just bad backgrounds.</p>
    <img src="assets/img/thedab.gif">
    <p>I love this gif, not because I enjoy its contents, but because it is something that is amusing to me in an ironic sense.</p>
    <p>And lastly, my favorite example of ironic humor can be found in youtube videos. For example:</p>
    <h2 style="background-color:crimson; width:325px; padding-left:2px;">Warning: Video is very loud.</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/peolMD1Ounk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <hr>
    <div class="actuallyOkay">
        <p>To be entirely clear, I do know how to make things look fairly inoffensive.</p>
        <h3>Headers are fun to mess with and are very useful!</h3>
        <p>
            However, I should mention that I don't have a great innate sense of style, so if I am to make a website,
            I will likely need to start with a template or layout planned and then get several doses of outside
            perspectives to make sure whatever I make isn't a nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that comic sans is generally bad for professional situations, and that some color combinations are awful.
            However, I don't have a great concept of what is aesthetically pleasing or what color combinations are GOOD,
            so outside help is often necessary with me. That said, if you give me certain colors and shapes to work with,
            I am very good at making those things.
